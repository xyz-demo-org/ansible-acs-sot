ansible-acs-sot

This repo is a Source of Truth repository for infrastructure changes made to ACS via Ansible using the ansible-acs-integration repo.  This repository has been made public in order to demonstrate how infrastructure changes can be documented over time.  You should use a privately hosted repository for your own source of truth, hosted by a cloud vendor (GitHub, GitLab, etc..) or a self-hosted alternative like Gitea.
